#  AI-Powered Multi-Modal Product Search  

##  Project Overview  
This project aims to build an **AI-driven product discovery platform** that allows users to search for products in a **human-like, intuitive way**. Instead of relying only on traditional keyword search, the system supports:  

- **Natural language search** → Users can describe what they need (even vaguely) and receive product suggestions.  
- **Image-based search** → Users can upload an image to find visually similar products or related categories.  
- **Hybrid understanding** → The AI bridges vague human descriptions or visual cues to the actual products available in the inventory.

##  Original Project Plan  

At the start, the project was designed to include the following phases:  

### **Phase 1 – Core Search System**  
- Build **natural language query processing** using an LLM.  
- Enable **web search + product page extraction** for supplementing vague queries.  
- Connect processed results with the **local product database**.  

### **Phase 2 – Image Search Integration**  
- Use **Google Cloud Vision API** to extract labels, objects, and features from user-uploaded images.  
- Pass extracted features to the LLM to generate product category mappings.  
- Add **direct image similarity search** using open-source models.  

### **Phase 3 – Multi-Modal Fusion**  
- Combine image features and text descriptions to improve product recommendations.  
- Handle **ambiguous inputs** (e.g., “something cozy to wear at home” or uploading a vague lifestyle image).  

### **Phase 4 – User Interface (UI)**  
- Design and implement an **intuitive UI** supporting text input, image upload, and results display.  
- Add navigation features (categories, filters, sorting).  

### **Phase 5 – Deployment & Scaling**  
- Deploy application to a scalable cloud platform.  
- Optimize APIs and database queries for performance.  
- Add personalization features (user history, preferences).

##  Progress So Far  

###  Implemented Features  
1. **Natural Language Search**  
   - Accepts vague/free-form queries.  
   - LLM reformulates queries into structured search.  
   - Performs **web search → product page parsing → local database matching**.  

2. **Image-Based Search (Vision API Integration)**  
   - Extracts attributes and objects from uploaded images using **Google Cloud Vision**.  
   - Converts extracted features into descriptive queries for the LLM.  
   - Maps results to available product categories.  

3. **Direct Image Similarity Search**  
   - Implemented using **open-source image embedding models**.  
   - Matches uploaded images with product images in the inventory.  

### ⚙️ Tech Stack  
- **OpenAI API** → Natural language understanding & query generation.  
- **Google Cloud Vision API** → Image feature extraction.  
- **Custom Web Scraper** → Retrieves product details for query matching.  
- **Open-source Image Models** → Embedding-based similarity search.  
- **Database (Inventory)** → Product categories and metadata.

##  Upcoming Updates  

### **Near-Term**  
-  **Fully Functional UI** (interactive product browsing & hybrid search).  
-  **App Deployment** (cloud hosting & backend integration).  
-  **Search Optimization** (improved embeddings, faster query handling).  
-  **Enhanced Navigation** (filters, categories, personalization).  

### **Long-Term**  
-  **Personalized Recommendations** (user history, mood/context awareness).  
-  **Analytics Dashboard** (track queries, trends, inventory gaps).  
-  **E-commerce Integration** (direct purchase flow from search results).  
-  **Multi-language & Cross-Region Support**.

##  Summary  

The project has successfully implemented its **core search engine** with **natural language and image-based queries**. By combining **LLMs, computer vision, and database matching**, we now have a foundation for a **multi-modal, intelligent product discovery platform**.  

The upcoming focus will be on **UI development, deployment, optimization, and navigation features**, eventually evolving into a **scalable e-commerce-ready solution**.
